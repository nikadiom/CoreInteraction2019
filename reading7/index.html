   <h1>Reading Response 7</h1> 
    "The notion of the “meme” was introduced by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the late
1970s as a way to describe what he called a “cultural gene.” Memes are units of culture and behaviour,
which survive and spread via imitation and adaptation. Examples of memes are dances, catchphrases,
greetings, hairstyles. "
     
    Memes serve a purpose of protest in modern day community. They are known to be identified as modern day 'political posters'. I think that mems are more effective than any type of propaganda because they are esy to share with the community, and are communicated in an easy and funny way that everyone would understand. Al  it takes is to upload a jpg image online to share a message. It also allows the younger generation to be active participants in discusions.
