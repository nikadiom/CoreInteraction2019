    "you can really discover 99 different ways to speak 1 language"
    This quote made me think a lot about the way one story can be <br>told. There really infinity ways of presenting information through language, and each and every one of these ways can <br>completely twist the way we are going to percept this information. After I read the different ways the story was <br>told, I did not feel bored. I found it very interesting to look at spomething from so many different angles
