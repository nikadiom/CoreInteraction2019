   <h1>Reading Response 8</h1> 
   The questions that I HAVE ABOUT THIS READING ARE:
    Who's concept of time is more accurate, human or machine? <br><br>
    Also, isnt time relative?<br><br>
    Is it possible to function without time? Can world be present?<br><br>
    
    Is it true that time can be only measured in movement? Why?<br><br>
    
    How does the concept of time change over the course of our lives?
