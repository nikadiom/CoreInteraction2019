   <h1>Reading Response 6</h1> 
material design serves a purpose of unifying the design of apps for google. it is standardization of design process to make it easier and fall under one kind of language. It tries to unify styles.
    
    Me myself: I like the idea of a system, it simplefies the process of understanding for the user. For example the standardized iconography hints you what the app might be about.
