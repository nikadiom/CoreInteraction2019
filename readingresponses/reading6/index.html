   <h1>Reading Response 6</h1> 
 <br>   “In an age of information overload, a room is comforting 
 <br> because it’s finite, often with a specific intended purpose.” <br> 
 <br> -Louis Rossetto <br>  <br>  <br> 

I think that in our time, the digital representation of an 
  individual has <br>a great importance for the society. Almost everyone has Instagram this days,<br>which is a direct 
  representation of one to the society. Web is what we make 
 <br> it, it will have the identity you give it, and you can turn
it into anything you want.
