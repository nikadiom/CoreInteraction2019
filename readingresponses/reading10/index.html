   <h1>Reading Response 10</h1> 
  
 "The change went from 19th century hot metal typesetting with
its very complex and expensive mechanized equipment invented by Monotype and <br>
Linotype, through a period of opto-mechanical photocomposition systems, in
which printing with cast letter-forms was replaced with exposure of optical <br>
outlines on spinning disks of glass onto light-sensitive paper, to the digital
simulation of similar processes, formulated in computer programs and executed <br>
first by huge room-filling installations and later by affordable home computers"
    <br> <br>
    
This abstract made me realize how different nature of type design is in 21st c3ntury, and how dramatic are the changes. <br>Progress happened so fast. Progress defenetly plays to our advantage. It allows us to produce type qimes faster than <br>before, and allows us to manipulate the variety.
