   <h1>Reading Response 3</h1> 
    
<b>"The proliferation of images on the
internet has changed the way we look at art because we are exposed to an unprecedented deluge of images
online."</b> I agree with thuis statment. Nowdays we have so much information out there, and the amount of images we see daily really effects the way we see and understand art. Art became a digital experience ratheer than physical, and I think that it efeected the apreciation of it.
    
   <b> To paraphrase Croatian artist Mladen Stilinović’s 1994 banner embroidered with the claim that ‘an artist who
cannot speak English is no artist’, today one could say that a young artist who doesn’t have a website is no artist.</b> This is so true. I feel like having a website is an obligation nowdays, otherwise you wont be considered a professional.S
