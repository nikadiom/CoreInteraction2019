   <h1>Reading Response 1:</h1> 
    
 <p> “In an age of information overload, a room is comforting <br>because it’s finite, often with a specific intended purpose.”<br>
-Louis Rossetto<br><br>

I think that in our time, the digital representation of an <br>individual has a great importance for the society. Almost <br>everyone has Instagram this days, which is a direct <br>representation of one to the society. Web is what we make <br>it, it will have the identity you give it, and you can turn<br> it into anything you want.
