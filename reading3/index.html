   <h1>Reading Response 3</h1>
    <b>1.Kameelah Janan Rasheed on research and archiving</b><br>
    Whenever she creates work there’s always a possibility of her not necessarily knowing it connects to everything else that she’s made. "She creates material she’s reading into one thing, listening to this other thing, and floating passively between lots of different registers. This process is generative to her because it then allows her to create something that intimately connects different things that you may not imagine being related."
    
    
  <br><br> <b> 2.Rutherford Chang on the art of collection</b><br>
  He is a record collector, except focusing it on a very particular item. He works with material that has some kind of cultural meaning that people are familiar with already. "I interact with it to rearrange it in a way that’s going to reveal something more about its nature." He makes people realize that some things they never thought of are art too.  
    
    
   <br><br> <b>3.Ordinary plenty by J. Keith</b>
    
He like the idea of owning your content and then syndicating it out to social networks, photo sites, and the like. He points out the idea that we pick and choose what we save, and that characterizes us. we become responsible for what we own.
