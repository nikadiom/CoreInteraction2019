   <h1>Reading Response 4</h1> 
   This reading really made me thing about the materiality of design and how we people don't design things for function anymore. For example a car for 20,000 dollars will have the same trunsportation functions as a car for 50,00, yet we desire the one that is more expensive/cool/fancy/etc. People are starting to loose the apreciation of things and their function. The same comes to graphic design. The visua intertaining of design became the most important, and functionality comes second.
