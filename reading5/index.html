 J. R. CARPENTER || A Handmade Web
    <br><br>
  "I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
identity"<br>
    Crration of webpage in the past was nothing else but hand labor, however nowdays it is mostly softwears. I think that a web page that is created with both can become more engaing. Not everything on the page has to be originated digitally. It is radical to be able to hand code nowdays.
