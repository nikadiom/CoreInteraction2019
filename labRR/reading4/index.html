  <br><br> <b> 2.Wht is Scripting, and how is it used?</b><br>
    
 Scripting is the idea of executing a program from within a web page is as old as the web itself.  The universal interpreted programming language finally arrived in 1996. It was written in ten days by a programmer at Netscape named Brendan Eich. That is how Java-script was born.It is used for writing imperative code that runs in a web browser.
    
    
  <br><br>  <b> 3.What makes a website with Java-script so special?</b><br>
    It becomes interractive and responsive. JavaScript gave web designers the power to create websites that were slicker, smoother, and more reactive. The same technology also gave web designers the power to create websites that were sluggish, unwieldy, and more difficult to use. Now the user can create a new browser window.
