<b>what do we mean when we say responsive?</b>
    Responsive Web Design is a mechanical concept, the brainchild of a single person, based on finite, specific elements. n this reading they talk about the laanguage structure and how it evolves, and the defenition becomes fluid. Anyways, an im oppinion, responsive design is very important in terms of the way we design the interface. It allows us to experiment with diiferent hierarchy and for different screen sizes. "So that raises the possibility that we’re using “responsive” in certain cases to communicate…well…web design, done thoughtfully."
