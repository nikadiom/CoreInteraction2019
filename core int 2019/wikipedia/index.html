   <h1>Glass (2019 film)</h1> 
    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   <p><strong>Glass</strong> is a 2019 American <a href="gg.com">superhero thriller film[6]</a> written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film <br>is a sequel to Shyamalan's previous films Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016), cumulatively forming the Eastrail 177 <br>Trilogy and serve as the final installment for the franchise.[7] Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Spencer Treat <br>Clark, and Charlayne Woodard reprise their Unbreakable roles, while James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy return as their <br>Split characters,[8] with Sarah Paulson, Adam David Thompson, and Luke Kirby joining the cast. In the film, David <br>Dunn gets locked in a mental hospital alongside his once-rival Mr. Glass, as well as the multi-personality "The <br>Horde," and must escape from a psychiatrist who is out to prove the trio do not actually possess super-human abilities.<br><br>

<br>While there was interest in creating a sequel to Unbreakable following its release, Touchstone Pictures opted not to <br>finance one at that time despite the film's solid box office performance. Shyamalan set out to write Split using a <br>character he had written for Unbreakable but pulled from the script due to balance issues. Shyamalan realized the <br>opportunity he had to create a trilogy of works, and adapted the ending of Split to establish the film as within the <br>Unbreakable narrative. This included securing the rights to use Willis's Unbreakable character from Walt Disney <br>Studios, with the promise of including them within the production and distribution of this third film alongside <br>Universal Pictures, should it be made. Split was a financial and critical success, and by April 2017, Shyamalan <br>announced that he had started the production process for Glass.<br><br>

<br>The film was released on January 18, 2019, by Universal Pictures in the United States and by Walt Disney Studios Motion <br>Pictures under the Buena Vista International label in international territories. It has grossed over $104 million <br>worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with some finding it underwhelming and lamenting the climax, <br>although the performances (particularly McAvoy's and Jackson's) and the entertainment value of the first half were praised.[9][10]</p>

   <h3> Plot</h3>
Three weeks after Kevin Wendell Crumb earns the nickname "The Horde"[N 1], vigilante David Dunn and his <br>now-grown son Joseph, who have been working together to take down criminals, set out to save four <br>cheerleaders Crumb has abducted. David comes across Kevin in his "Hedwig" persona and, after brushing <br>up against him, discerns the cheerleaders' location using his powers of extrasensory perception. He <br>frees all four cheerleaders and confronts Kevin in his "Beast" persona only for the ensuing fight to <br>spill out into the streets, where the two are captured by local authorities.
<br><br>
<br>The two are sent to a mental institution where Elijah Price, David's sworn enemy, known as "Mr. <br>Glass," is being held. Dr. Ellie Staple, the head doctor of the mental institution, works with <br>patients who claim to have special powers. Staple reveals that she has been given three days to <br>persuade David, Kevin, and Elijah that they are "normal" people who simply believe they have super <br>powers. Staple also knows that David's alleged weakness is water and has a machine that forces The <br>Horde to switch identities, effectively disarming The Beast.
<br><br>
<br>Joseph, Mrs. Price, and Casey Cooke (who survived an attack from the Beast) all visit at separate <br>times to attempt to aid their associates, but fail. Staple puts the three superhumans in one room for <br>an evaluation and poisons David and The Horde with doubt of their abilities, accusing David of having <br>the same ability as trained magicians and Dennis (a persona of The Horde) of copying rock climbers <br>and being shot by bad cartridges.
